      <p>Hey, my name is Gabriel Silk, and I've been writing software for about 20 years. I entered college when I was 14, studied computer science / math, and landed my first job at Electronic Arts when I was 17. For the last six years I've worked professionally in Silicon Valley, first for Quantcast and then as a founding member at Nomic, where I explored some product ideas in the recruiting space with my colleagues Nate Boyd and Aaron Boyd. Now I'm a consultant, helping companies of all stages/sizes with their technical and product needs.</p>
      <p>My product philosophy is <i>functional minimalism</i>: that is to say, function before flashiness, without loss of comprehensibility. As far as coding, I believe that every line is a liability, the best diff is all minuses, and that if your code outweighs your tests, you're in trouble.</p>
      <p>In my spare time I like to <a href="https://medium.com/training-for-climbing">climb</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gabrielsilk">travel</a>, read books, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gsilk">make weird music</a>, and work on <a href="https://github.com/gsilk">open source software</a>.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in getting in touch, email me at: <a href="mailto:gabesilk@gmail.com">gabesilk@gmail.com</a></p>
